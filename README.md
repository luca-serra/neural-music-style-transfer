# Neural Music Style Transfer

This repository contains our last year Deep Learning project which consists in building a Neural Music Style Transfer program. The major part of this project is on music generation (Jazz and Classical music) and the second part is focused on the style transfer between these two genres.

# Requirements


The required packages can be found on ` requirements.txt`.

This repository contains `.ipynb` files which are designed to be used inside [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It is more suited to download the files and open them inside Colab but one may execute them in a standard Jupyter Notebook environment.

# Data

The data necessary for this project were used in [this study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07575.pdf) and [this study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03535.pdf).

More information can be found in the `models` folder README.

# Results

The results of our work are detailed in this paper TODO: lien vers le papier

A few generated songs of our models can be heard [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-367037269) on Soundcloud

A little quiz (Google Form) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkeH5jZ16TkFFxTYAGkCwFxho8-IIBFKtkLmycTc01ty-I9A/viewform): can you find if these musics are from humain or AI?
